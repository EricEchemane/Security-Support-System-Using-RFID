# Security Support System Using RFID
A security support and attendance system for St. Bernadette College of Alabang. This project uses RFID as the identification device of students and staffs. It monitors the visitation records of each person in the building through RFID readers with NodeMCU that communicates with the server through websockets. Students and staffs can tap their RFID cards and the system automatically records their time in as they enter the building and time out as they go out.
